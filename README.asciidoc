fedup-dracut - initramfs environment for Fedora Upgrades
========================================================
Will Woods <wwoods@redhat.com>

This is 'fedup-dracut', the initramfs environment for Fedora Upgrades.

It has the following components:

`90system-upgrade/`::
    This module provides a (distro-neutral) framework for running upgrades.
    * Adds three dracut hooks: `upgrade-pre`, `upgrade`, and `upgrade-post`.
    * Adds `upgrade.target`, which runs the above hooks (in order)
    * Automatically includes any other modules named `system-upgrade-*`
    * Defines `UPGRADEROOT` and `UPGRADELINK` paths
    * Saves those to `/run/initramfs/upgrade.conf` if both exist
    * 'BONUS:' adds upgrade-debug-shell.service

`85system-upgrade-fedora/`::
    This is the Fedora `system-upgrade` implementation.
    * Includes upgrade tool, SELinux policy, plymouth, etc.
    * Copies initramfs to `$UPGRADEROOT`
    * Runs 'system-upgrade-fedora' binary in the `upgrade` hook
    * Save log & journal to `/var/log/upgrade.{log,journal}` before reboot

`system-upgrade-fedora.c`::
    The actual upgrade tool.
    * Requires *rpm >= 4.10.0*, *plymouth >= 0.8.6*, and *glib2*
    * Upgrades system using packages from `$UPGRADELINK`
    * Sends progress updates to `plymouthd`
